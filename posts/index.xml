      <description>go get within a mod is different inside a module vs outside; local installation vs project go.mod
  go.sum database of hashes; goprivate telling go to go direct
  Import paths; inside vs outside; everything is absolute
  So I was wondering what the deal with is with how go modules handle git tags, and what happens when a git repo doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any git releases/tags.</description>

      <description>Hello The tutorial which helped me the most has been this: http://dev.im-bot.com/jekyll-travis-github/ Although When I was following there still were a few things which were unclear. So here we are&amp;hellip;
1. Getting a skeleton Jekyll website up I discovered that someone already made a template repo: https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-nowOr fork from https://github.com/joshcarp/joshcarp.github.ioI guess it&amp;rsquo;s advised to get Jekyll running locally, even though the end game is to have it all deployable through travis; Sometimes you&amp;rsquo;ll install a plugin and want to test it locally/ need to install another Gem or something.</description>
