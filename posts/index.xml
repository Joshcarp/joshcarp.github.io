      <description>GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go1.12.4 build -o static/main.wasm main.go  cp /usr/local/go/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js . This needs to be from the same go installation that compiled the go wasm file
now to test, we can use a node command
node wasm_exec.js wasm/arrai eval &amp;lsquo;41 + 1&amp;rsquo;</description>

      <description>Hello The tutorial which helped me the most has been this: http://dev.im-bot.com/jekyll-travis-github/ Although When I was following there still were a few things which were unclear. So here we are&amp;hellip;
1. Getting a skeleton Jekyll website up I discovered that someone already made a template repo: https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-nowOr fork from https://github.com/joshcarp/joshcarp.github.ioI guess it&amp;rsquo;s advised to get Jekyll running locally, even though the end game is to have it all deployable through travis; Sometimes you&amp;rsquo;ll install a plugin and want to test it locally/ need to install another Gem or something.</description>
